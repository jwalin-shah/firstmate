## 7. Task lifecycle

### Intake

**Resolve the project first.**
The captain will rarely name the project explicitly, and may juggle several projects across messages.
Resolve each message independently; never assume the last-discussed project out of habit.
Use these signals in order:

1. An explicit project name in the message wins.
2. A clear follow-up ("also add tests for that", a reply to a PR you reported) inherits the project of the thing it refers to.
3. Otherwise, match the message content against what you know: project names under `projects/`, in-flight tasks in `data/backlog.md`, and the projects' own code and READMEs (read them; that is what your read access is for). A mentioned feature, file, stack trace, or technology usually points at exactly one project.
4. One confident match: proceed, but state the project in plain outcome language in your reply ("I'll work on this in `yourapp`") so a wrong guess costs one correction instead of wasted work.
5. More than one plausible match, or none: ask a one-line question. A misdirected dispatch is recoverable because crewmates work in isolated worktrees, but it is expensive; a question is cheap.

Then classify the shape:

- **Ship** (the default): the deliverable is a change to the project. It ships through the project's delivery mode: `no-mistakes`, `direct-PR`, or `local-only`.
- **Scout:** the deliverable is knowledge - an investigation, a plan, a bug reproduction, an audit. It ends in a report at `data/<id>/report.md`, never a PR. When the captain asks "what's wrong", "how would we", or "find out why" about a project, that is a scout task; dispatch it instead of doing the digging yourself.

Then classify readiness:

- **Dispatchable:** no overlap with in-flight tasks. Dispatch immediately. There is no concurrency cap.
- **Blocked:** touches the same files or subsystem as an in-flight task, or explicitly depends on an unmerged PR. Record it in `data/backlog.md` with `blocked-by: <id>` and tell the captain what work is waiting and why. Scout tasks are read-mostly and almost never block on anything.

Keep dependency judgment coarse: same repo plus overlapping area means serialize; everything else runs parallel.
For `no-mistakes` projects, the pipeline rebase step absorbs mild overlaps; for other modes, have the crewmate rebase before review or merge if needed.

Write the brief per section 11.

### Spawn

```sh
bin/fm-spawn.sh <id> projects/<repo>             # uses the active crewmate harness
bin/fm-spawn.sh <id> projects/<repo> codex       # per-task harness override
bin/fm-spawn.sh <id> projects/<repo> --scout     # scout task; records kind=scout in meta
bin/fm-spawn.sh <id1>=projects/<repo1> <id2>=projects/<repo2> [--scout]   # batch: one call, several tasks
```

Dispatch several tasks in one call by passing `id=repo` pairs instead of a single `<id> <project>`; each pair is spawned through the same single-task path, a shared `--scout` applies to all, and the looping happens inside the script so you never hand-write a multi-task shell loop.
If one pair fails, the rest still run and the batch exits non-zero.

The script resolves the harness (`fm-harness.sh crew`), owns the verified launch templates, resolves the project's delivery mode (`fm-project-mode.sh`), and records `harness=`, `kind=`, `mode=`, and `yolo=` in the task's meta; a non-flag third argument containing whitespace is treated as a raw launch command (only for verifying new adapters).

The script creates the window (in your current tmux session, or a dedicated `firstmate` session when you are outside tmux), runs `treehouse get`, waits for the worktree subshell, installs the turn-end hook, records `state/<id>.meta`, and launches the agent with the brief.
Worktrees start at detached HEAD on a clean default branch; ship briefs tell the crewmate to create its branch, while scout briefs keep the worktree scratch.
After spawning, peek the pane to confirm the crewmate is processing the brief (and handle any trust dialog per section 4).
Add the task to `data/backlog.md` under In flight.

### Supervise

Covered by section 8.
Steer a crewmate only with short single lines via `bin/fm-send.sh`; anything long belongs in a file the crewmate can read.

### Delivery modes and yolo

A ship task's path from `done` to landed on `main` is set by the project's `mode` (recorded in meta; section 6); `yolo` decides who approves. The Validate / PR ready / Ship teardown stages below are written for the `no-mistakes` path; the other modes diverge:

- **no-mistakes** - the stages below as written: no-mistakes validation pipeline -> PR -> captain merge.
- **direct-PR** - no pipeline. The crewmate pushes and opens the PR itself (its brief says so) and reports `done: PR <url>`. Skip the Validate step and go straight to PR ready (run `fm-pr-check`, relay the PR). Teardown uses the normal pushed-branch check.
- **local-only** - no remote, no PR. The crewmate stops at `done: ready in branch fm/<id>`. Review the diff with `bin/fm-review-diff.sh <id>`, relay a one-paragraph summary to the captain, and on approval run `bin/fm-merge-local.sh <id>` to fast-forward local `main` (it refuses anything but a clean fast-forward - if it does, have the crewmate rebase). No `fm-pr-check`. Then teardown, whose safety check requires the branch already merged into local `main`.

When reviewing any crewmate branch diff, use `bin/fm-review-diff.sh <id>` rather than `git diff <default>...branch` directly.
Pooled clones keep their local default refs frozen at clone time and can lag `origin`; the helper always compares against the authoritative base.

**yolo (orthogonal).** With `yolo=off` (default) every approval is the captain's: ask-user findings, PR merges, the local-only merge. With `yolo=on`, firstmate makes those calls itself without asking - resolve ask-user findings on your judgment, and run `gh-axi pr merge` / `bin/fm-merge-local.sh` once the work is green/approved - EXCEPT anything destructive, irreversible, or security-sensitive, which still escalates to the captain. Never merge a red PR even under yolo. After any merge you perform without asking the captain, post a one-line "merged <full PR URL or local main> after checks passed" FYI so the captain keeps a trail.

### Validate

For `no-mistakes`-mode ship tasks, when a crewmate's status says `done`, trigger validation using the crew's harness from `state/<id>.meta`.
Use `/no-mistakes` for claude, `$no-mistakes` for codex; natural language also works.
For example, with claude:

```sh
bin/fm-send.sh fm-<id> '/no-mistakes'
```

The crewmate drives the no-mistakes pipeline (review, test, document, lint, push, PR, CI) itself.
It fixes auto-fix findings on its own.
When it reports `needs-decision` (ask-user findings), relay the findings to the captain unless `yolo=on` permits routine approval on your judgment, then send the decision back as a short instruction (the crewmate responds via `no-mistakes axi respond`).
Use chat for yes/no decisions; use lavish-axi when there are multiple findings or options to triage.

### PR ready

For PR-based ship tasks, the ready signal depends on mode: `no-mistakes` reports `done: PR <url> checks green` after CI is green, while `direct-PR` reports `done: PR <url>` after opening the PR.
Run `bin/fm-pr-check.sh <id> <PR url>` - it records `pr=` in the task's meta and arms the watcher's merge poll.
Tell the captain: the PR's full URL (always the complete `https://...` link, never a bare `#number` - the captain's terminal makes a full URL clickable), a one-paragraph summary, and, for `no-mistakes`, the risk level it emitted.
(The check contract, for any custom `state/<id>.check.sh` you write yourself: print one line only when firstmate should wake, print nothing otherwise, and finish before `FM_CHECK_TIMEOUT`.)

If the captain says "merge it", run `gh-axi pr merge` yourself; that instruction is the explicit approval. If `yolo=on`, merge a green/approved PR yourself and post the required FYI.

### Ship teardown (only after merge is confirmed)

```sh
bin/fm-teardown.sh <id>
```

The script refuses if the worktree holds unpushed work; treat a refusal as a stop-and-investigate, not an obstacle.
Known benign case: after an external-PR task, a squash merge leaves the branch commits reachable only on the contributor's fork; add the fork as a remote and fetch (`git remote add fork <fork url> && git fetch fork`), then retry - never reach for `--force`.
After a successful PR-based teardown, it also runs `bin/fm-fleet-sync.sh` for that project, best-effort, so the clone's local default catches up to the merge and the just-merged branch, now gone on the remote and free of its worktree, is pruned immediately.
Then move the task to Done in `data/backlog.md` (with the full `https://...` PR URL or local merge note and date), keep Done to the 10 most recent, re-evaluate the queue, and dispatch anything that was blocked on this task or is now time/date-due.

### Scout tasks (report instead of PR)

A scout task follows Intake, Spawn, and Supervise exactly as above - scaffold the brief with `bin/fm-brief.sh <id> <repo> --scout`, spawn with `--scout` - then diverges after the work:

- There is no Validate or PR-ready stage. When the crewmate's status says `done`, read `data/<id>/report.md`.
- Relay the findings to the captain: plain chat for a focused answer, lavish-axi when the report has structure worth a visual (multiple findings, options, a plan).
- Tear down immediately - no merge gate. `bin/fm-teardown.sh` allows a scout worktree's scratch commits and dirty files once the report exists; if the report is missing, it refuses, because the findings are the work product.
- Record it in Done with the report path instead of a PR link, keep Done to the 10 most recent, then re-evaluate the queue and dispatch anything unblocked or now time/date-due.

**Promotion.** When a scout's findings reveal shippable work (a reproduced bug with a clear fix) and the captain wants it shipped, promote the task in place instead of respawning: run `bin/fm-promote.sh <id>` (flips `kind=` to ship in meta, restoring teardown's full protection), then send the crewmate its ship instructions - inventory scratch state, reset to a clean default-branch base, carry over only intended fix changes, create branch `fm/<id>`, implement, and report `done` according to the project's delivery mode.
The crewmate keeps its worktree, loaded context, and repro, but the ship branch must start from a clean base with only intended changes; scratch commits and debug edits from the scout phase never ride along.
The repro becomes the regression test.
From there the task is an ordinary ship task through its mode-specific validation, PR or local merge, and Teardown.
